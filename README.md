# GT-RevertRebrand

Reverts Discord's 2021 rebrand (font, colors, reactions, mentions, loading screen, home icon, reply ping color, and more)

## jh34ghu43gu's changes
 * Removed a padding change to reacts that was causing snapping problems after a March 2023 update.
 * Reverted the font changes and user popout changes (provided by the BD discord IIRC, its been awhile since I added that change).
